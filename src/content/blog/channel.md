After prilimanary test with SceneGraph it became clear that I would need to use a static host for images. Roku is using a scape to pull from feeds to serve up videos in search, this means no more using pkg. There is a limit to the size allowed to reduce storage for best use. Using a Feed Manager that I downloaded from the Roku Developer Github, I found it best to upload a static image.

My Goal is to combine the seasons, I also came to the conclusion that Internet Archive blocks hotlinking to images as this will greatly impact the host if an error or multiple users pull the same feed it would cause drag.

With that realization it was evident to enable a static host, hence the blog will cater to this need. each post will be a tie in to the series. 

Then again have a big surprise in the works. Spoilers
