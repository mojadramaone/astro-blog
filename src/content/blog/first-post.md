After prilimanary test with SceneGraph it became clear that I would need to use a static host for images. Roku is using a scape to pull from feeds to serve up videos in search, this means no more using pkg. There is a limit to the size allowed to reduce storage for best use. Using a Feed Manager that I downloaded from the Roku Developer Github, I found it best to upload a static image.
