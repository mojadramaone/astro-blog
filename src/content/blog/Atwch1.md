Mr. Phileas Fogg lived, in 1872, at No. 7, Saville Row, Burlington Gardens, the house in which Sheridan died in 1814. 

Keeping to story reading formaility, I created a narrator themed around giving the reader insight and instructions. The orginal creation was produced in Plotagon Story which included premium voices that were paid for on a monthly basis. By default, we are only given 2 voices with the option to alter pitch and speed.

This proved to be highly complicated with additional casting. Each episode was attached to background music in a loop sequence.
