You may have read the book or seen a version of this film. Though I'm pretty positive never had it read in Character format and had access to subtitles. And that's exactly how I began.

At launch I made characters and tailored voices to match the personality, as 2D animation was running into limitations. Therefore relying heavily on green screen aka Chroma Key.

For what I was able to accomplish with Plotagon Story overall I was thrilled and honestly was gathering a little fan base along way. Near the end of the book I started getting feedback, Bring some AI into the mix.

I did my homework and stumbled into Augie Studio, Better known as Augmented Video. It was a perfect match that has connections to Eleven Labs for the realistic voices and database for imagery.

Yes I know they have music as well. But I found this easier with Uppbeat.Io and Pixabay.
